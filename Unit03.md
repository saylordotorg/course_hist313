**Unit 3: War and Westward Expansion** <span id="3"></span> 
*American settlers’ incessant westward expansion across the North
American continent brought the United States into conflict with Native
American inhabitants as well as the Mexican government during the first
half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.  Indian wars were as old as the
American colonies themselves, but they took on a particular intensity in
the 19<sup>th</sup> century as the American government attempted to open
up large sections of land in the trans-Appalachian frontier for American
settlement.  The American Army and volunteer militia forces relentlessly
pursued Indian warriors and ruthlessly destroyed native villages and
crops in an effort to wipe out all resistance.  By the 1850s, most
native tribes east of the Mississippi had been relocated to small
reservation sites. *  
  
 *American military forces also fought a controversial war against
Mexico for control of southern Texas and the modern-day states of New
Mexico, Arizona, and California.  The Mexican War resulted in a complete
victory for American forces but also highlighted the weaknesses and lack
of training of many of the volunteer units (as compared to professional
army units) in the conflict.  It also engendered a vocal anti-war
movement that made its presence known in the halls of Congress and the
streets of American communities. *  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine how America’s wars of westward expansion
reflected American social and political attitudes toward Native
Americans and Mexican citizens.  We will also look at how these
conflicts shaped the development of American military tactics and
strategies and provided military leaders with wartime experience that
they would draw on a decade later, during the American Civil War.*
