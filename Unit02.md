**Unit 2: 1812 - The Second War for American Independence** <span
id="2"></span> 
*The American Revolution secured American political independence from
Great Britain, and a generation later, the War of 1812 reaffirmed that
the young nation would remain free from British imperial domination and
continue to assert its rights as an independent country.  Americans
objected to British mistreatment of American ships and sailors, as well
as Britain’s continued economic and political support of militant Indian
tribes throughout the Old Northwest.  The war was not universally
popular in the United States; during the middle of the conflict, some
New Englanders even threatened secession if the conflict continued.  The
conflict tested America’s young military and highlighted the weaknesses
of its volunteer militia forces.  It also demonstrated the importance of
a strong navy, since Great Britain effectively blockaded much of the
American coast during the war and used ship-borne troops to capture
Washington, D.C. and threaten Baltimore.  The war ended in late 1814
with a negotiated peace treaty that maintained the status quo ante
bellum, but Andrew Jackson’s surprising victory in early 1815 against
British regulars at the Battle of New Orleans restored American pride in
her military abilities and national strength.  In this unit, we will
focus on the origins of the conflict and examine how each side pursued
wartime objectives.  We will also examine the social impact of the War
of 1812 on the American people and look at the lessons it offered
American military leaders for generations to come.*

     The French Revolution began in May 1789 with the meeting of the
    Estates-General—a general assembly representing the three French
    estates of the realm: the nobility, the church, and the common
    people.  Summoned by King Louis XVI to propose solutions to his
    government’s financial problems, the Estates-General sat for several
    weeks in May and June 1789 but came to an impasse as the three
    estates clashed over their respective powers.  It was brought to an
    end when many members of the Third Estate formed themselves into a
    National Assembly, signaling the outbreak of the Revolution.  On
    July 14 of that same year, the Bastille—a medieval fortress and
    prison which represented royal authority in the center of Paris—was
    stormed by a mob that demanded the arms and ammunition stored there.

    Louis XV and his wife tried to escape Paris in 1791, the French

    went badly and prices rose sky-high. In August 1792,a mob assaulted
    the Royal Palace in Paris and arrested the King.  In September, the
    Assembly abolished the monarchy and declared a republic.
