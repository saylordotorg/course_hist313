**Unit 11: The Global War on Terror and the New World Order** <span
id="11"></span> 
*During the first decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the threat of
militant Islamic terrorist organizations across the globe has largely
dictated America’s military commitments.  Following the 9-11 attacks,
American military forces engaged in two major conflicts in Afghanistan
and Iraq.  The Iraq invasion came as part of President George W. Bush’s
doctrine of preemptive war, designed to eliminate threats to American
national security.  While American forces enjoyed great success in their
military objectives, they encountered great difficulties maintaining the
post-war peace and rebuilding local and national infrastructures in Iraq
and Afghanistan.  These wars also generated serious doubt as to whether
America can combat terrorism without compromising her fundamental
political and social values.  In this final unit, we will examine the
challenges currently facing American military forces and look at how a
decade of conflict has reshaped American social and political
expectations regarding the role that the military should play in
international affairs.  Finally, we will look beyond the first decade of
the 21<sup>st</sup> century and consider future challenges that the
American military may face and how these challenges will affect American
society.*
