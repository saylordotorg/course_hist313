**Unit 4: Brother Against Brother - The American Civil War** <span
id="4"></span> 
*In 1861, social and political tensions that had been growing since the
founding of the American Republic finally boiled over.  Southern leaders
feared that the federal government would attempt to regulate slave
owning as a precursor to an outright ban on the practice.  Advocates of
states’ rights used Republican Abraham Lincoln’s 1860 election as
grounds for secession from the Union.  Just as secession tore the nation
apart, it also splintered America’s military forces.  Many southern-born
officers returned to their home states to organize military units to
defend the new Confederacy against invasion from the North. * *The Civil
War was a total war that took a heavy toll on civilian populations,
particularly in the South.  The war also highlighted the obsolescence of
traditional battlefield tactics in the face of modern firearms and
artillery.  The northern victory restored the Union, but the post-war
occupation of the South raised serious questions about the role of the
military as a political tool of the federal government.  In this unit,
we will examine the origins of the Civil War and look at the military
strategies of the North and South.  We will also examine the
consequences of the war for civilian populations in the North and the
South, and look at why the war marked an important turning point in the
history of the United States.*
