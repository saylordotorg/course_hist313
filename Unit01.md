**Unit 1: War and the Founding of the United States** <span
id="1"></span> 
*European military conflicts throughout the 18<sup>th</sup> century
contributed to the formation of the United States in the 1780s. 
British, French, and Spanish forces fought incessantly throughout this
period and American colonists were often caught in the middle of these
global conflicts.  Great Britain’s costly victory in the French and
Indian War in 1763 led to higher taxes on American colonists, which
generated social and political turmoil throughout the colonies.  A
decade later, frustrated American colonists challenged British political
rule directly and eventually secured independence from the mother
country after a lengthy military struggle.  In this unit, we will
examine how the French and Indian War and the American Revolution forged
unique social and political values in the early United States.  We will
also look at how these conflicts shaped American cultural identities and
redefined the relationship between civilian and military leaders in the
New Republic.  *
