**Unit 9: Vietnam** <span id="9"></span> 
*The Vietnam conflict grew out of America’s Cold War commitment to
limiting the global spread of Communism.  After Vietnamese national
liberation forces defeated French colonial troops in the mid-1950s, the
state was partitioned into Communist and democratic regions.  After
Communist guerilla forces in South Vietnam began to threaten the
government in the early 1960s, the United States sent military advisors
to the region to help South Vietnamese forces defeat the Communists. 
This initial commitment of ground troops expanded into a full-scale
military campaign by 1964.  Over the next seven years, United States
military forces fought battle after battle against South Vietnamese
guerillas and North Vietnamese regular army troops.  Public opinion in
the United States initially favored American involvement, but a vocal
anti-war movement gradually swung opinion against the war by the late
1960s.  American forces were eventually withdrawn from Vietnam, but not
before the war took a heavy toll on U.S. military strength and American
confidence. *  
 *             
 In this unit, we will examine how the United States became involved in
Vietnam and look at how American strategy changed over the course of the
conflict.  We will also explore how the fringe anti-war movement
gradually gained social acceptance and political influence during the
conflict.  Finally, we will look at how the Vietnam conflict had a
lasting impact on American politics and military strategy.*

    criticisms of U.S. actions in Vietnam. Former serviceman John Kerry
    presented this statement to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign
    Relations in 1971. Kerry argues that the U.S. military is committing
    wartime atrocities in Vietnam and justifying the unnecessary deaths
    of Vietnamese civilians and U.S. soldiers as part of a broader Cold
    War agenda. He asserts that Americans must unite to end the war
    before it destroys the fabric of American society.
