**Unit 5: War and American Imperialism** <span id="5"></span> 
*Following the Civil War, the United States became more involved in
international affairs, particularly in Latin and South America. 
American naval forces traveled across the globe, securing and protecting
American trading rights in Japan, China, and other parts of Asia.  In
1898, the United States took on the aging Spanish Empire and seized
control of the islands of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines.  With
these acquisitions, America obtained strategic bases from which it could
extend its military influence across the Caribbean and the Pacific. 
Some Americans objected to this growing imperial power.  Following the
Spanish-American War, numerous anti-imperialist groups organized protest
campaigns.  While these campaigns had little impact on American military
and political affairs, they reflected deep-seated tensions within
American society about America’s founding principles and global
mission. *  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine the ways in which American economic and
military imperialism reshaped the United States’ relationship with the
developed and developing world.  We will also look at American attitudes
towards race, class, and economic development and see how these social
attitudes were reflected in American military actions in the
late-19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries.*
