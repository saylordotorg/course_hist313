**Unit 8: The Cold War** <span id="8"></span> 
*At the end of the Second World War, the democratic United States and
the Communist Soviet Union emerged as the world’s major economic,
political, and military superpowers.  Both nations felt threatened by
the existence of the other and attempted to secure military alliances
across the globe.  The U.S.’s and, later, the Soviet Union’s acquisition
of nuclear weapons made the conflict even more threatening.  Since
neither side could attack the other directly, both pursued their
political agendas through proxy wars.  The Cold War had a profound
impact on American society as well.  Fears of Communist infiltration led
to Communist “purges” in the American government and academia. 
Political dissent was viewed as disloyalty.  The constant need for new
and advanced weapons and defense systems led to a powerful relationship
between the military, American industry, and the American university
system.  This military-industrial-academic complex held considerable
influence over elected officials and played a dominant role in shaping
the post-war economy.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine the origins of the Cold War and examine
how the United States engaged in wars and policing actions across the
globe in an attempt to limit the spread of Communism.  We will also
study the domestic impact of the Cold War and look at how the 50-year
conflict shaped American political, economic, and social life.*
