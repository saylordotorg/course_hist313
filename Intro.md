Course Syllabus for "HIST313: War and American Society"
-------------------------------------------------------

This course will focus on the wars and military conflicts that have
shaped the social, political, and economic development of the United
States from the colonial era through the present.  You will learn how
these conflicts have led to significant changes in America social and
political life during this 300-year period.  The course will be
structured chronologically.  Each unit will include representative
primary-source documents that illustrate important overarching themes,
such as how colonial conflicts in the 18th century shaped the political
organization of the United States, how regional conflicts in the 19th
century culminated in the Civil War, how America cemented its status as
a major world power through participation in the First and Second World
Wars, how Cold War conflicts destabilized American social and political
life, and how modern conflicts continue to redefine American social and
political values and ideals.  By the end of the course, you will
understand how three centuries of warfare have reshaped America's
relationship with the world and altered American society in unexpected
ways.
