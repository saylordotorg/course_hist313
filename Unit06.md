**Unit 6: The First World War** <span id="6"></span> 
*Despite America’s growing involvement in world affairs in the early
20<sup>th</sup>century, the* *American people continued to be wary of
political or economic alliances with European nations.  These concerns
were justified by the outbreak of World War I in 1914.  Separated from
Europe by three thousand miles of ocean, Americans hoped to remain
isolated from the deadly conflict.  American President Woodrow Wilson
supported American neutrality, but eventually changed his mind in 1917,
following German attacks on American passenger and cargo vessels. 
Wilson then argued that American military forces could turn the tide of
the struggle, which would allow the United States to play an important
role in the post-war settlement.  Many Americans supported the war
effort, but a vocal minority objected to the conflict for various
reasons.  Wilson used the coercive power of the federal government to
arrest and imprison numerous protestors.*  
 *             
 In this unit, we will examine how American forces fought on the Western
Front and the lessons they learned from bloody struggle.  We will also
focus on the American home front during the war and study the ways in
which the conflict led to new economic and social opportunities for
women and minorities.  Finally, we will examine how the war led to
American disenchantment with military affairs and a period of renewed
isolation from world politics.*

    by the Society of Friends (Quakers) presents the Society’s moral
    objections to American participation in World War I.  They argue

    but instead desire to achieve peace through other means.
