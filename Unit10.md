**Unit 10: The End of the Cold War** <span id="10"></span> 
*Following a decade of détente and diplomatic engagement with the Soviet
Union, the United States assumed a more confrontational attitude towards
the Communist regime in the 1980s.  This new attitude came in response
to Soviet military aggression in Afghanistan and other parts of the
world.  The U.S. began a large rearmament program centered on the
Strategic Defense Initiative, or “Star Wars,” a space-based system of
satellites that could destroy nuclear missiles and prevent Soviet
attacks on the U.S.  While many of these advanced military systems never
moved beyond the testing stage, Soviet efforts to counter new American
military technologies eventually bankrupted the regime and hastened its
fall at the end of the 1980s.  With the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the U.S. had to realign its national defense objectives.  During the
1990s, the nation began to downsize its regular military forces while
increasing its commitments to peacekeeping missions across the
world. *  
 *             
 In this unit, we will examine how the end of the Cold War changed
American political and social expectations about the role that the
American military should play in international affairs.  We will also
look at the regional conflicts in which U.S. military forces engaged in
the 1990s, including the Gulf War and peacekeeping missions in Somalia
and the former Yugoslavian republics, exploring the ways in which these
wars affected American society and politics.*
