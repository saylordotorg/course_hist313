**Unit 7: The Second World War** <span id="7"></span> 
*As war broke out in Europe at the end of the 1930s, America once again
attempted to remain neutral.  Unofficially, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt wanted to support Great Britain against Nazi Germany, but
public sentiment was against American involvement in the conflict. 
Instead, Roosevelt used indirect means to support Britain, lending the
nation badly-needed naval destroyers in exchange for American access to
British bases in the Atlantic.  America finally entered the war in late
1941 following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  Over the next four
years, the nation sustained combat operations in both the Pacific and
European theatres of conflict.  This required a massive civilian and
industrial commitment on the home front.  In this unit, we will examine
the major strategies that the U.S. employed in World War II and take a
look at how the conflict affected Americans at home.  We will also
examine the cultural legacy of the war and discuss why, in hindsight,
many Americans viewed the conflict as the “Good War."*

     Instructions: Please read the entirety of this website to better
    understand the American response to World War II.  President
    Franklin Roosevelt delivered this speech five months after the Pearl
    Harbor attack.  In it, Roosevelt describes the wartime challenges
    that America faces abroad and calls on Americans at home to unite in
    support of the war.  He asks Americans to make economic sacrifices
    and do without luxuries in order to ensure that scarce resources go
    to the war effort.  He argues that these sacrifices will guarantee
    an American victory.
